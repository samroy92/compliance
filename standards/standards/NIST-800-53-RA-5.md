##Vulnerability Scanning
#### Description
The organization:
  a.  Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;
  b.  Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
    1.  Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
    2.  Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
    3.  Measuring vulnerability impact;
  c.  Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
  d.  Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
  e.  Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).
