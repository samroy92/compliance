#NIST-800-53-SA-17 3
##Formal Correspondence
#### Description
The organization requires the developer of the information system, system component, or information system service to:
   (3)(a).  Produce, as an integral part of the development process, a formal top-level specification that specifies the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware in terms of exceptions, error messages, and effects;
   (3)(b).  Show via proof to the extent feasible with additional informal demonstration as necessary, that the formal top-level specification is consistent with the formal policy model;
   (3)(c).  Show via informal demonstration, that the formal top-level specification completely covers the interfaces to security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware;
   (3)(d).  Show that the formal top-level specification is an accurate description of the implemented security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware; and
   (3)(e).  Describe the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware mechanisms not addressed in the formal top-level specification but strictly internal to the security-relevant hardware, software, and firmware.
