#NIST-800-53-IA-5 1
##Password-Based Authentication
#### Description
The information system, for password-based authentication:
   (1)(a).  Enforces minimum password complexity of [Assignment: organization-defined requirements for case sensitivity, number of characters, mix of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters, including minimum requirements for each type];
   (1)(b).  Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: [Assignment: organization-defined number];
   (1)(c).  Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;
   (1)(d).  Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [Assignment: organization-defined numbers for lifetime minimum, lifetime maximum];
   (1)(e).  Prohibits password reuse for [Assignment: organization-defined number] generations; and
   (1)(f).  Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.
No information found for the combination of standard NIST-800-53 and control IA-5 (1)
